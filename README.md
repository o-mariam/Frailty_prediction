# Dissertation Project: Feature Extraction from Physiological Data

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a data processing pipeline designed to extract statistical features from physiological datasets. The focus is on analyzing frailty through various physiological metrics, including heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate (RR), and accelerometer data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Tkinter for GUI (if applicable)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is composed of multiple CSV files located in the `Dataset/Frail` directory. Each file contains physiological signals collected from participants.
